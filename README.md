# Introduction 
This repository hosts the starting solution for potential engineers to review and evaluate for discussion during the technical interview sessions

# Getting Started
There are two projects in this solution
1. An API that provides the ability to query the NY Taxi dataset directly in BigQuery
2. An example of a frontend built in React that uses the API to present the dataset

# API
The API consists of a single controller with the controller providing two slightly different queries:
1. The first handles the large set of data points by returning the data in aggregate
2. The second returns individual datapoints

# Task
1. Review both projects
2. Have the solution running and working on your own laptop that you should bring with you to the technical interview sessions
3. Create a list of issues / concerns / opinions on the solution. The items should be a mixture of architectural, design and code level issues
4. Be prepared to discuss your concerns and reasons why you have those concerns

# Technical interview
During the technical interview you will be asked to:
1. present your findings and show, by way of opening the code and pointing out specific aspects, errors or concerns you have.
2. make a selection of changes to the solution potentially based on your recommendation but also on our recommendations over a period of 60-90 minutes
3. show the functioning changes and discuss further
